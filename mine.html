<h2>Opening Prayer: Funke</h2>
<h3>Review of Previous Meeting</h3>
<p>The minute of the last meeting was read by Ibukunoluwa after which the motion for adoption was moved by Kemi and it was seconded by Michael. </p>
<p>The Anchor (Ibukunoluwa) introduced the newest member, in person of Omowunmi, to the House who was rightly and warmheartedly welcomed by all present. </p>
<p>The President gave his opening remark/welcome address as usual and afterwards showed his disappointment at the turn out of members</p>
<h3>Matters Arising</h3>
<p>Ibukunoluwa suggested that we draw up a plan on how things should unfold for the group in the year 2019.</p>
<p>Kemi suggested we can be rotating our meeting place because some of our members are clamouring for the school premises to be our meeting venue. She also suggested that we fix our next meeting on a Saturday maybe we might register high turnout of members. Akeju objected on the changing of venue for our meetings basing his objection on the fact that our current meeting place is still in Mushin which is still in very close proximity with the school and he also suggested we should have a fixed date/period for our subsequent quarterly meetings. Funke supported his suggestion.</p>
<p>Wale welcomed the new member once again and suggested that we should consider the yearnings of members as to the issue of venue and he also urged the president not to feel disappointed about the turnout of members for the meeting because we are still very much young. Wale also expressed concerns about what could still be causing setback for us in the group.</p>
